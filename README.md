# Markdown Experiments
## Headings

Can you have emphasis within a title?

### Looks like you *italicize*, but the heading is already **bold**

Can you have links inside headings?

### Yes, [you certainly can](https://github.com/jeffDevelops/markdown-experiments/edit/master/README.md)

Can you make lists with headings?

- ## A hyphen, and then hashes for a heading work, but don't look great
## - The other way around does not

So, I imagine

1. ## An ordered list works the same way, but looks even more not-great
## 2. And this is a heading at the end of the day.

How about blockquotes with headings?
> ## They're silly with H1s and H2s because they have the underlines,
> ## But H6 - H3 look semi decent.
