# Markdown Experiments
## Headings

Can you have emphasis within a title?

### Looks like you *italicize*, but the heading is already **bold**

Can you have links inside headings?

### Yes, [you certainly can](https://github.com/jeffDevelops/markdown-experiments/edit/master/README.md)

Can you make lists with headings?

- ## A hyphen, and then hashes for a heading work well
## - The other way around does not

So, I imagine

1. ## An ordered list would work the same way
## 2. Right?
